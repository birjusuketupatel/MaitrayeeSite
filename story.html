          <p>
            I grew up in Gujarat, learning music. Since a very young age of four,
            Shri Ishwarbhai Parekh tutored me all the way to earn Sangeet Visharad
            degree with a gold medal. My guruji always shares this story that I
            started learning so young, I used to sit in my mother's lap while he
             taught me! Even earlier than that, when I was about two years old, I
             have a vivid memory about me pretending to be a teacher and teach
             nursery rhymes to the neighborhood kids much older than me!
            <br>
            <br>
            My parents had a huge contribution towards providing me the kind of
            environment that a student of music requires. My mother and I would
            sing what I learned in class together while doing kitchen work, braiding
            my hair and during our drive to nearby towns. And I must say she has
            the sweetest voice that I have heard on the planet! My dad too enjoyed
            music. He would bring out the harmonium after dinner and play old
            Bollywood melodies. Music used to be our leisure time activity for the family.
            <br>
            <br>
            My guruji's teaching style was exceptional too. He focused on bringing
            out the right kind of emotions through notes. And that's why when I share
            songs on social media, I often hear my friends mentioning about
            'soulful singing'. Also, he would often take me to perform at temples
             during festivities and parayan katha. Singing in temples cultivated my love for
              devotional music and instilled sanskaar of spirituality. It made
             me realize that music is divine in nature.
            <br>
            <br>
            While teaching, my guruji would often make bhajans and dhoon on the
            spot and compose them too. He would ask me to join and improvise as he
            sang. I used to be amazed at his impromptu creations and that made me
            think... how I wish to create my own compositions! Now I write my own
             songs because of this background that he gave me.
            <br>
            <br>
            I am lucky enough that after getting married, my husband Suketu Patel
            too provides the same kind of support that my guruji and parents gave.
            Being raised in the States, he has no idea about Indian music; but still
            he encourages me in every possible way. He inspired me to make three
            cds of my original compositions. He learned to operate a sound system
            just for my concerts. He helped me open my own music studio
            where I currently teach students. I hope to continue this tradition
            of music and pass it to my students in a way my guruji taught me!
